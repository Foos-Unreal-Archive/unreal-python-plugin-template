### Info
- `My-Plugin` rename the folder to your plugin name.
- `My-Plugin.uplugin` Rename this file to your plugin name, and open it with a text editor & edit the content.
- `.gitignore` is setup to prevent unneeded python files from being commit to your git-repo.
- `requirements.txt` Add your pip/pypi dependencies to this file, delete it if not used.
- `README.md`: It's a good practice to include a brief description & image, so people can see what your plugin is about before installing it.
